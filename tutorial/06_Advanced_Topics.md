# Advanced Topics in NLP with SpaCy

In this tutorial, we'll delve into some advanced topics in Natural Language Processing using SpaCy. We'll cover custom model training, integrating with other libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch, and applying NLP to real-world problems.

## Custom Model Training

SpaCy provides tools to train your models on specific datasets. This is particularly useful for tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER), text classification, and more.

### Training a Named Entity Recognizer

Here's how you can train a simple NER model:

```python
import spacy
from spacy.training import Example
from spacy.util import minibatch, compounding

nlp = spacy.blank('en')  # start with a blank English model
ner = nlp.create_pipe('ner')
nlp.add_pipe('ner')
ner.add_label('GADGET')  # add a new entity type to the NER pipeline

# Training data
TRAIN_DATA = [
    ("I love using the iPhone", {"entities": [(17, 23, 'GADGET')]}),
    ("Samsung has released a new phone", {"entities": [(0, 7, 'GADGET')]}),
]

# Set up the training loop
optimizer = nlp.initialize()
for i in range(100):
    losses = {}
    batches = minibatch(TRAIN_DATA, size=compounding(4., 32., 1.001))
    for batch in batches:
        for text, annotations in batch:
            doc = nlp.make_doc(text)
            example = Example.from_dict(doc, annotations)
            nlp.update([example], sgd=optimizer, drop=0.5, losses=losses)
    print(f"Losses at iteration {i}: {losses}")

```

## Integrating SpaCy with Deep Learning Frameworks

You can combine SpaCy's capabilities with deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch for more advanced models.

### Using SpaCy with PyTorch

Here’s a brief example of integrating SpaCy with PyTorch for custom text classification:

If the SpaCy model `en_core_web_lg` is not available and you need to download it. Here's the proper way to download it:
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
```

```python
import spacy
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Dummy example of a PyTorch model
class TextClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(TextClassifier, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(300, 2)  # Now matches input vector size of 300

    def forward(self, x):
        return torch.sigmoid(self.fc(x))

# Load SpaCy with a model that has 300-dimensional vectors
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_lg")

# Example text
doc = nlp("SpaCy and PyTorch are fun!")
doc_tensor = torch.tensor([token.vector for token in doc], dtype=torch.float32)

# Instantiate and use the classifier
classifier = TextClassifier()
predictions = classifier(doc_tensor.mean(0).unsqueeze(0))  # Use the mean of the vectors
print(predictions)
```

## Applying NLP to Real-World Problems

Finally, let’s explore a practical application. Suppose we want to analyze customer feedback:

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
feedback = "The new update is terrible, it's slower than before and crashes frequently."

doc = nlp(feedback)
sentiment = doc.cats['POSITIVE'] if 'POSITIVE' in doc.cats else "Negative"
print("Feedback sentiment:", sentiment)
```

## Conclusion

This tutorial provided a glimpse into advanced NLP techniques using SpaCy. You've learned about custom model training, integration with deep learning frameworks, and real-world applications, setting you up for complex NLP challenges.
