# Word Vectors and Text Similarity with SpaCy

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to work with word vectors and measure text similarity using SpaCy. Word vectors are numerical representations of words, which capture semantic meanings and relationships between words in a high-dimensional space. Text similarity measures allow us to quantify how similar two pieces of text are to each other.

## Word Vectors in SpaCy

SpaCy provides word vectors as part of its pre-trained models. These vectors are obtained using techniques like word embeddings, which capture semantic relationships between words based on their usage in context.

```python
import spacy

# Load the pre-trained model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Access word vectors
word = nlp("apple")
print(word.vector)
```

## Measuring Text Similarity

SpaCy allows us to measure similarity between words, phrases, or documents using word vectors. Similarity scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating greater similarity.

```python
doc1 = nlp("cat")
doc2 = nlp("dog")
similarity_score = doc1.similarity(doc2)
print(similarity_score)
```

## Applications of Text Similarity

Text similarity measures have various applications, including:
- Document clustering
- Information retrieval
- Recommender systems
- Duplicate detection
- Paraphrase detection

## Visualizing Similarity

We can visualize text similarity using heatmaps to gain insights into the relationships between different pieces of text.

```python
from spacy import displacy

displacy.render([doc1, doc2], style="dep", jupyter=True)  # Use jupyter=False if not in a Jupyter notebook
```

## Conclusion

This tutorial covered the basics of working with word vectors and measuring text similarity using SpaCy. You've learned how to access word vectors, calculate similarity scores, and visualize similarity relationships. These techniques are essential for a wide range of NLP applications.
